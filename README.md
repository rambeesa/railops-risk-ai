RailOps AI Command Center is an end-to-end AI application that predicts operational risk in real time and presents actionable insights through an enterprise dashboard.
The system demonstrates how machine learning can support safety-critical operations by transforming telemetry data into decision intelligence for operators.
This project focuses on production-style AI engineering — integrating model inference, APIs, visualization, and monitoring into a unified platform.
